# ðŸ“Š Productivity Tracker

This project helps students and users monitor their productivity by tracking time spent on educational tools and websites. It consists of:

- ðŸ§© A browser extension
- ðŸ–¥ A desktop application (Python-based, packaged as an `.exe`)

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### ðŸ“¥ 1. Download Components

- **Browser Extension**
  - [Download ZIP](./rwatch_extension/) and load it as an unpacked extension:
    1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
    2. Enable "Developer mode"
    3. Click "Load unpacked"
    4. Select the `extension/` folder

- **Desktop App**
  - [Download the `.exe`](./rwatch_application/main.exe) file from the `desktop-app/dist` folder
 

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The **extension** monitors browser activity on study-related sites (e.g., online IDEs, docs).
- The **desktop app** logs time spent in study apps like VS Code or Jupyter.
- Both components sync with a backend (coming soon) and generate visual productivity stats.
